 - added devtools/clean_all.sh. Note that first parameter to devtools/compile_all.sh will be added to the make command
 - devtools/precommit can be used to auto-generate the todo.txt
 - working on annotating sortings, including setting attributes of clusters and manual merges. Right now the only attribute of a cluster that is used is "assessment" which can be any string, eg "good", "noise", "artifact", etc.
