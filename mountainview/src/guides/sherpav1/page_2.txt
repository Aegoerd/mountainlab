Every detected event ends up in a cluster. As such, some clusters have a large proportion of outliers and noise events.

Click on "Event Filter" in the left panel. For outlier score, we suggest a value of 3. For detectability score, we suggest a value of 6. See the manuscript for details on these metrics. 


      
               - Outliers: Outlier filter, we suggest a value of 3 [see figure X, text X for explanation of outlier score calculation]
               - Noise events: Detectability score, we suggest a value of 6 [see figure X, text X for explanation of detectability score calculation]
